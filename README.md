# Philly After School

A static site: a directory of schools, and one page per school listing after-school
programs with a grade filter. Everything is generated from two data files.

## What's here

| Path | What it is |
|---|---|
| `data/programs.json` | One record per program. Each program lists the schools it serves. |
| `data/schools.json` | One record per school. Adding a record adds a page. |
| `site.config.json` | Site name, domain, contact email, support link, optional GTM ID. |
| `build.mjs` | Builds the site into `dist/`. Needs Node 18+, no installs. |
| `src/` | The stylesheet and the script for search and filtering. |
| `dist/` | The finished site, created by the build. Not stored in `main`; the `live` branch holds it. |

## Before launch

Fill in `site.config.json`:

- `contactEmail`: where corrections go. Until it's set, the site says a contact address is coming.
- `supportUrl`: where the Support button goes (currently a Venmo profile). If it's empty, the Support page says contributions are being set up.
- `supportLabel` and `supportHandle`: the button text, and the handle shown under it for people who'd rather search in the app.
- `siteUrl`: the domain you treat as the main one. Redirect the other domain to it at your host.
- `builtBy`: the name, link and short bio shown in the footer, on the home page and on About.
- `gtmId`: optional, e.g. `GTM-XXXXXXX`.

## Build

```
node build.mjs
```

The build stops with a plain-English list if the data has a problem (a missing field,
a bad link, a program tied to a school that doesn't exist), so mistakes don't reach the site.

To look at the site without a server: `PREVIEW=1 node build.mjs`, then open `preview/index.html`.

## How changes reach the site

1. A change is merged into the `main` branch (edit a file on GitHub, or approve a proposed change).
2. GitHub builds the site automatically (`.github/workflows/publish.yml`) and puts the finished files on the `live` branch.
3. The web host is connected to the `live` branch and deploys it.

If the data has a problem, step 2 stops and the live site stays as it was. The "Actions" tab on GitHub shows what went wrong.

To put the site on a different host, run `node build.mjs` and upload the contents of `dist/`.

## Edit a listing

Open `data/programs.json`, change the fields, set `lastVerified` to today's date, and commit to `main`.

Fields worth knowing:

- `grades`: a range like `"K-5"` or `"PK-3"`, a single grade like `"8"`, or `null` when the provider doesn't publish grades.
- `register.how`: `online` (needs `url`), `phone`, `contact`, `school` or `none`. `register.note` is shown next to it.
- `register.nextTerm`: optional. When sign-ups open for the next term, semester or school year, in a sentence with dates. Leave it out when the provider doesn't say.
- `note`: the yellow caution box. Use it for anything unconfirmed.
- `schools`: one entry per school the program serves:
  - `relation`: `onsite`, `pickup` or `nearby`. Use `pickup` only when a source names the school.
  - `note`: a caution that applies to that school only.
  - `distance`: optional, e.g. `"three blocks from Nebinger"`.
  - `registerUrl`: optional, for providers with a separate sign-up link per school.
  - `address`: optional, when a provider sends this school's children to a different location.
  - `sources`: optional, extra sources that apply to this school only (the school's own aftercare sheet, for example).

## Add a school

1. Add a record to `data/schools.json` (copy Nebinger's and change it). The `id` becomes the URL: `"meredith"` gives `/meredith/`. Optional fields: `dismissalNote` (staggered dismissal times), `checkedNoPickup` (providers checked that don't serve the school) and `alsoListed` (programs the school names that haven't been confirmed yet).
2. In `data/programs.json`, add that school's `id` under `schools` for every program that serves it. Most providers are already there; they just need the new tag.
3. Add records for programs that are new (the school's own clubs and on-site care).
4. Commit to `main`.

## The suggestion form

`/suggest/` posts to `suggest/send.php`, which the build generates. It emails each suggestion to
`contactEmail` and also appends it to `phillyafterschool-suggestions.log` in the folder above
`public_html`, so nothing is lost if an email goes missing. It needs a host that runs PHP.
A hidden field traps most spam bots.

## Analytics

Set `gtmId` to load Google Tag Manager on every page. The site pushes four events to the data layer:
`pas_filter` (filter_type, filter_value, school), `pas_outbound` (link_type of register or website,
program_id, school), `pas_suggest_submit` (suggest_kind, school) and `pas_support_click`.

## Keeping it current

`dist/data/programs.json` is published with the site, so a scheduled check can read exactly
what the site shows, compare each listing to its sources, and report what changed. Review
the report and merge the changes you agree with. Busy times: March to May (next year's registration opens)
and late August (rec centers post their listings).
